# decrypt

Cryptic biodiversity or subpopulations?

## Installation

First install [our Quetzal library](https://becheler.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)
and make sure you installed the project dependencies.

You will also need [BPP3.4](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software.html), but BPP4 should
also work.

Open a terminal, go to the directory of your choice and then clone our repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Becheler/decrypt.git
```

## Build the Quetzal simulations
```
cd decrypt/cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
